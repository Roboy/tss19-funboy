%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Alona Kharchenko, my good friend and main advisor, for her feedback, advice and all of the great projects we did together at Roboy. I also would like to thank Rafael Hostettler for the opportunity and the necessary resources for this project. Furthemore, I am grateful to Lora Koycheva who gave me support and very useful insight on the conducted experiment. 

Moreover, I want to thank the Roboy team for all the friends and experiences I made throughout the years.
