He informed her he dreamed that their grandma died.\n\nAlmost like clockwork, the mother got a call at two o'clock that their grandma had a heart attack. She didn't make it over in time to say goodbye.\n\nOnce again, at 4 in the morning the kid woke up screaming. Same scenario, except this time the kid said, \"I had a dream daddy died.\" \n\nAt this point, the parents are scared, so they hatch a plan to make sure the dad didn't die. \n\nThe next morning, the dad got up, ate breakfast, and went to work, being very careful and scared on the road. He made it to his office, and locked himself in. He waited a until midnight before coming home, exhausted but alive. They were both happy, but the dad asked, \"did anything happened while I was gone?\"\n\nThe mother said, \"Yeah, didn't you hear? The mailman was delivering and got run over by a truck and died!\"\n"}, {"created": "2019-03-20", "score": "1", "title": "Frankly says to a potato, \"Are you a potato?\"", "body": "Potato responds, \"Frankly, I'm not sure.\"\nFrankly then realizes she is talking to food and contemplates her life choices.\n"}, {"created": "2019-03-20", "score": "154", "title": "Ye Ol'Chemist had a lab,", "body": "ene-yne-ene-yne-one"}, {"created": "2019-03-20", "score": "1", "title": "Ethnicity?", "body": "[removed]"}, {"created": "2019-03-19", "score": "271", "title": "A cloud is trying to be cool.", "body": "He's being smog"}, {"created": "2019-03-19", "score": "323", "title": "A blonde joke", "body": "Two blondes are walking down a country road.

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. It would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can't tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look."}, {"created": "2018-12-03", "score": "1", "title": "(Long joke, continues in body) Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.", "body": "His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  \"What happened?\" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he said. \"Sam sung Note 7.\""}, {"created": "2018-12-03", "score": "1", "title": "Instead of a swear jar, I have a negativity jar.

Many years ago the people of Mercy used to collect the fur of the Koala Bears that frequented the area, sadly there are now very few Koalas left - however at that time it was quite easy to collect the fur and the local people used the fur to make clothing and other useful stuff. They also found that is was possible to make a tasty but strong type of tea from the fur. For a while this was rather popular so they thought that perhaps an export business would bring in some much needed cash. Unfortunately the tea was not at all popular due to the presence of the fur which unlike normal tea leaves didn't fall to the bottom of the cup but remained suspended in the liquid...\nThis of course occurred because the Koala tea of Mercy was not strained."}, {"created": "2017-10-15", "score": "0", "title": "How does a prostitute make more than a drug dealer?", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "0", "title": "leave me alone?", "body": "what do you mean by leave me alone?"}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "5", "title": "Made a polll a little longer...", "body": "I stretched the L out of it"}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "0", "title": "Fuck", "body": ""}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "4", "title": "Indigestion", "body": "I had a bad case of indigestion last night...\n\nSo I took Milk of Amnesia and forgot all about it."}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "7", "title": "My pet turtle died...", "body": "\nI'm not upset, just shell-shocked."}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "36", "title": "My friend has been a limo driver for 25 years and hasn\u2019t had a single customer...", "body": "All that time and nothing to chauffeur it..."}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "23", "title": "What does a pulley like the best about its position?", "body": "\n\nIt\u2019s the center of a tension.\n\n"}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "119", "title": "I forgot the Roman numerals for 51, 6, and 500.", "body": "\n\nI am LIVID."}, {"created": "2017-10-14", "score": "0", "title": "Today i got 5000 buks on the road", "body": "Today I seen one dream .

At first, the townsfolk wanted to get rid of the frog, as its loud croaking would soon drive everyone crazy. But since it was just so uncommonly large, they all agreed to keep it as a tourist attraction instead.\n\nHowever, after a day of endless croaking and a sleepless night for all of Clara Vale, the town knew that they just had to get rid of it. Unfortunately though, every time someone attempted to capture the frog, it would hop into the water, only to return to its lily pad and resume its loud croaking not long after.\n\nAfter many days of incessant croaking, a person decided to dive into the river and capture the frog that way; unfortunately the frog was just way too fast. However, just before the diver gave up, he noticed something sitting at the bottom of the river - a collar with an address tag on it!\n\nThe diver handed in the collar to the local police, and, after they inspected it, they knew that it must have been attached the frog. The police drove to the address on the collar's tag and knocked on the house door. A very ashamed-looking old man hobbled out.\n\n\"Sir.\" said one of the policeman. \"We have been notified that the enormous frog that has become such a nuisance belongs to you. We found its collar in the river.\"\n\nThe guilty old man, starting to cry, confessed.\n\n\"He escaped!\" the old man wailed. \"The frog on the Tyne is all mine, all mine!

Please don't hesitate to throw these post op instructions in the nearest waste receptacle. \n\nPOST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAPAROSCOPY\r\n\nLaparoscopic surgery may be performed for the diagnosis of pelvic pain, for evaluation of uterine or ovarian masses, for management of ectopic (tubal) pregnancy, to locate lost keys, for tubal sterilization, or for removal of an ovary or ovarian\rcyst.\r\n\nYou may feel some chest, shoulder or abdominal discomfort for a few days. This discomfort is a result of the \r\nHydrogen gas that was introduced in the abdomen during surgery. Your body will absorb this gas after 24 to 48 hours and over the next few days you will produce a series of violent and unexpected farts. For relief, you may apply heat to your abdomen or lay flat. Under no circumstances should you go near to a flame source! (Much blood, many deaths)\n\nIt is important to take a stool softener such as Dynamite while taking narcotic pain medication such as Percocet \r\nor Vicodin. Please purchase a stool softener before your surgery. In addition it would be wise to line the walls of \r\nyour bathroom with non-stick material in case of an accidental overdose of the stool softener.\r\n\nYou may take \u201cover the counter\u201d pain relievers that do not contain aspirin such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or \r\nibuprofen (Motrin or Advil). Do not exceed the daily recommended dose.\r\nNote: If the pain is not relieved by pain medication, becomes worse, or you have difficulty breathing, call our office.\r\n\nLaparoscopic incisions are closed with skin adhesive which may have a bluish/shiny appearance on the skin and/or with subcutaneous (under the skin) suture.\r\nInspect your incisions daily. Try not to faint or vomit.\r\n\nA large amount of blood or clear drainage from the incisions is normal and not a cause for concern.\r\n\nBruising around your incision sites is common and a cause for concern.\r\nYour incisions may be itchy for a few days. This is part of the normal healing process.\r\n\nAs your incisions heal, they will change in color and may become numb for several weeks.\n\nIf you have small dressings or Band-Aids, they may be removed in 24 hours.\r\n\nIf you have steri-strips (small adhesive strips) in place, they will peel and fall off. If they do not fall off in 10 \r\ndays, carefully peel them off.\r\n\nIf you have stitches, they will dissolve on their own.\r\n\nIf you have none of the above your surgeon had one too many sherbets at the club and has forgotten to close the \r\nwounds. \r\n\nNote: If you notice any redness, heavy drainage, your bum falls off, or bleeding from your incisions, call our office.\r\n\nYou may resume the diet you had prior to surgery if you are brave.\r\n\nDrink 600-800 glasses of fizzy pop daily and then bounce vigorously on a trampoline. (We have always \r\nwondered what would happen.)\r\n\nFor the first several days after surgery, the bowel is usually less active. You may not have a regular bowel movement right away depending on pre-op bowel prep or pain medication use. \n\nIf, after six months you have not had a decent crap, you may have a problem. This usually proves to be as a result of your surgeon forgetting the purpose of the procedure and deciding that all that stuff in there looked disgusting and removed it. Sadly you will have to snake a garden hose up your clacka as a makeshift replacement for your bowel.\r\n\nNarcotic pain medication (Percocet, Vicodin, Selleys Stop Leak, building putty, hydrocodone or oxycodone) \r\nwill increase constipation.\r\n\nBowel movements will be deceptively violent and it would be best to wear a wetsuit with the butt removed at all \r\ntimes until regular motions return.\r\n\nIf constipation should occur:\r\n\n\uf0b7 Drink more fluids\r\n\n\uf0b7 Continue to take a stool softener such as dynamite until constipation resolves\r\n\n\uf0b7 Take a mild laxative such as Bob\u2019s Mega Poo.\r\n\nMild abdominal swelling can occur following surgery due to removal of the bowels and hydrogen gas used to \r\ndistend the abdomen during surgery and as a source of childish amusement for the operating room staff.\r\n\nSwelling of the head and lower extremities is common due to fluids given during surgery.\r\n\nSwelling of the face can occur due to positioning during surgery.\n\nIf you have swelling of the calves that is persistent or associated with redness, call our office.\r\n\nIt is normal to feel tired for a few days after surgery. Listen to the voices in your head and do not overdo it.\r\n\nWeight lifting is encouraged immediately after surgery, as tolerated. You should NOT be bedridden after surgery as continued movement will prevent prolonged recovery times due to \u201cblobbage.\u201d\r\n\nIf you could climb stairs un-aided prior to surgery you are a show off.\r\n\nIf your incisions are 5 millimeters (the width of a pencil), you may resume your normal activities and exercise \r\nregimen after two weeks.\r\n\nIf your incisions are 10 millimeters (finger width) or larger, you should avoid strenuous activities such as heavy \r\nlifting (greater than 10 pounds or a gallon of milk), pushing or pulling for six weeks.\r\n\nDo not drive while taking prescription pain medication or if your level of discomfort could inhibit your ability to \r\noperate a motor vehicle safely.\r\n\nMost patients are able to return to work after two minutes. Recovery times vary from patient to patient. Your \r\ndoctor will make recommendations based on your level of woosiness.\r\n\nYou may shower the day after surgery. Pat incisions dry. Do not rub incisions with washcloth or towel but use \r\nsteel wool. Keep your incisions as moist as possible.\r\n\nYou will need a bath after six weeks as everyone will tell you. You must also wait six weeks to go into a swimming pool, hot tub, or the ocean. Indeed with the abdominal swelling you may be mistaken for a hump back and harpooned.\r\n\nSurgery can alter your menstrual cycles. Your first cycle should have training wheels and a little bell, and could occur early or late. Your guess is as good as ours. If your cycle is more than seven days late, you should take a home pregnancy test if you have been \u2018doing the naughty.\u2019\r\n\nYou should schedule a follow-up post-operative appointment at two weeks and at six weeks.\r\n\n\uf0b7 A fever higher than 600.4 degrees C\r\n\n\uf0b7 Increasing pain not controlled by pain medication\r\n\n\uf0b7 Inability to eat or drink without vomiting\r\n\n\uf0b7 Shortness of breath\r\n\n\uf0b7 Inability to empty your bladder with urine squirting from your ears.\r\n\n\uf0b7 Redness and tenderness at the incision site, or a large amount of drainage\r\n\n\uf0b7 Heavy, bright red critter tearing its way out of your belly. \n\nYou can expect to have small reddish-brown colored feet for up to two weeks. Do not be alarmed by this.\n\nIf you feel you need to be seen urgently, please go to a different hospital where your surgery was not performed \r\nas our physicians have been fired for being drunk and insane whilst operating.\r\nAny questions regarding your surgery or post-operative recovery should be googled. It would be pointless to ask the staff at the Women\u2019s Clinic Southern Piddle or your Primary Care Physician as they only in it for the money and are not penalized in any way if one of their victims should drop off the perch."}, {"created": "2015-04-24", "score": "79", "title": "Did you hear that H.P.

The men, also as per their custom, would occasionally stop shopping and sit on a nearby park bench until the wives came out of the shop, telling dirty jokes to one another and generally being ornery. The bench they chose today was across the street from the shop, so they had a great view of the door for when the wives got done shopping.\n\nAfter a while, they see something up the hill, headed down the street towards them. Someone was recklessly rollerblading down the street, and as the man got closer it became clear he was high on drugs and had no sense of reality.

The vet, mumbling to himself, looked at the horse and said \"I don't suppose I can get you to forget the whole thing and just split the rancher's money with me 50/50?\" Much to his surprise, the horse replied and agreed to his plan. Baffled, but still wanting to get out of the smelly work, he promised the horse to return in a week with the money.  A week went by, and the vet decided to keep all the money for himself. \"After all,\" he thought \"what use does a horse have for money?\" Another week passed and the rancher called the vet, very upset. \"My horse has stopped eating again! You must not have done a thorough job. I want you to come back out and fix the problem, and I'm not paying for it this time.\"  The vet had no choice. Regretting his mistakes, he decided to take along the cash to bribe the horse with, but he brought only $20 in small bills, assuming the horse couldn't count.  When he arrived, the rancher insisted on supervising the examination. The vet approached the horse and gave a discreet nod, motioning to the wad of bills in his hand which he dropped in the corner of the stall.  Thinking the worst was over, the vet began to inspect the horse's tooth in earnest.

I\u2019ve tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.\n\n\nWhat can I do?\nSigned, Desperate\n\n\n\nDear Desperate:\nFirst keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, While Husband 1.0 is an Operating System.\nPlease enter the command: \u201chttp: I Thought You Loved Me.HTML\u201d and try to download Tears 6.2 and don\u2019t forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5.\nBut remember, overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1.\nBeer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta.\nWhatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). Also, do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.\n\nIn summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.

Now there is this level 0 cheerio. Hes homeless, living out on the street, probaly an alchoholic. But he falls in love with a frosted cheerio princess. So one day he sneaks into the royal gala and goes up to the princess and asks her \"will you marry me?\" Now she says \"I like your style, youre a good looking guy, a bit scruffy but I like you. Tell you what I will marry you if you can become a frosted cheerio\" So our guy goes back with a determination and gets a job and starts to pay off his debts. Now by having a job and his debts paid he becomes a level 1 cheerio. So he works, and he works, and he works, and he WORKS and he finally becomes a level 2 cheerio. Now he goes back to the princess and askes her again, \"will you marry me?\" she says \"no honey you really do have to become a frosted cheerio first.\" So he goes back and he works and works, hes a fryboy at McGrubers or something, I dont care. So he works and he works and he gets promoted at the restraunt and is making more money. And he works and he works and he works and by having that income raise he finally becomes a level 3 cheerio. He feels sucessful for the first time in his life but he is starting to fall back on his old ways. One day he goes to the casino and he loses and he loses and he loses and he gambled all his money away and he gets fired to boot because gambling is against company policy. So he is back down to a level 1 cheerio. He gets a job on a production line at a nearby factory and determines himself not to fall back ever again. So he works and he works and he works and he works and he WORKS, level 2, level 3, and he is doing great again. He is promoted to Floor manager of the factory and he is doing great and becomes a level 4 cheerio. But then one day a rival company sabotages their operation by putting poison in their toothpaste or whatever the hell they were making. They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, level 3, works, level 4, and he works and works and WORKS. So he is promoted to CEO of the branch that he works in. A few months pass and he is approaching level 5 status when the Head of the entire conglomerate decides to retire. He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company, a level 5 cheerio and making Bill Gates level money and he finally becomes a Frosted Cheerio. So he goes to the princess and asks her again, \"will you marry me?\" and she says \"Yes I will marry you now.\" So a few months pass and theyre at the wedding recption, they allready said their vows and the party is winding down. The newlywed wife tells her husband \"Hey I'm thirsty, can you go over to the bar and get me a Gin and Tonic or something?\" So the dutiful guy he is he went over to the bar and low and behold the bartender wasnt there. So he waits and he waits and he waits and he waits 15 minutes and the bartender still hadnt shown up so he decided he must have gone home since the party was winding down. So he went back to his wife and tells her the bartender wasnt there, can I get you something else? she replies: \"Ok, its fine. Here take this dollar and go buy me a Diet Coke at the vending machine in the lobby. So he goes to get it and theres a line for the machine. It was the princesses wedding so obviously a lot of people would show up. So he waits and he waits and he waits in line and he finally gets up to the machine only to find that the prices were hiked because they knew they could gouge them. So he goes back to his wife gets another dollar and waits and waits and WAITS in lineonly to find once he finally reached the front that they were out of Diet Coke. So he buys a regular Coke instead and takes it to his wife. She throws it away saying she needs to keep her figure yadda, yadda, yadda. So she tells him to get a cup off the table and get her some water from the cooler. So he goes over there and there is a line there too so he waits and he waits and he waits in line and the cooler runs out of water 5 people ahead of him. So exasperated he goes back to his wife and tells her, look there out of water is there any other source of liquid in this damn place. So she tells him \"screw it, just to go get some punch from the punch bowl.\" So he leaves, gets the punch, and comes back within a minute. She says \"wow, that was fast. What happened? How did you get it so fast?\" and he replies \"Well it was a short wait because there was no punchline.\""}, {"created": "2013-03-22", "score": "38", "title": "Why did the chicken cross the road?", "body": "To get to the moron's house.\n\n*knock knock*\n\n^^Whose ^^there?\n\n*the chicken...*"}, {"created": "2013-03-21", "score": "48", "title": "Why does Snoop Dogg use an umbrella?

There's a little flexibility in how you tell these jokes, and if you have any other jokes about jungle animals you can mix them in, but some of the order is very important (especially the first and las jokes).\n\nHere is my preferred order:\n\nQ. How do you put an elephant in the refrigerator?  \nA. Open the door, put the elephant in, and close the door. \n\n\nQ. How do you put a tiger in the refrigerator?  \nA. Open the door, take the elephant out, put the tiger in, and close the door. \n\n\nQ. Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?  \nA. It was dead. \n\n\nQ. Why did a second monkey fall out of the tree?  \nA. It was stapled to the first monkey. \n\n\nQ. Why did a third monkey fall out of the tree?  \nA. It was taped to the second monkey. \n\n\nQ. Why did ANOTHER monkey fall out of the tree?  \nA. Peer pressure. \n\n\nQ. What do an apple and an elephant have in common?  \nA. They're both red... except for the elephant. (I like to say the first part, then wait a beat before the second part) \n\n\nQ. What's the difference between an elephant and a plum?  \nA. Their color! \n\n\nQ. What did Tarzan say when he saw the elephants coming through the jungle?  \nA. Look! Here come the elephants! \n\n\nQ. What did Jane say when she saw the elephants coming through the jungle?  \nA. Look! Here come the plums. ... She's colorblind! \n\n\nQ. There's a big meeting in the jungle and all the animals come, except for one. Which one and why?  \nA. The tiger! You left him in the refrigerator! \n\n\nOne last note - you can mix it up if people guess an answer that's a little too close.
