Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.\n\nSometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. \n\nOne day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThat night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.\n\nThe next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.\n\nHe honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.\n\n\"Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\n\"Well, then can I become a monk?\"\n\n\"Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.\"\n\nSo the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk.\" \n\nSo the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.\n\n\"Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?\" asked the new monk.\n\nThe head monk replied, \"The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.\"\n\n\"Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.\"\n\nWell, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. \n\nUnfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!\n\nOver the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.\"\n\n\"Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.\"\n\nThe new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.\n\nEventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. \n\nThe three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.\n\nOver the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!\n\nOver the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!\nHe had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.\"\n\n\"Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.\"\n\nThe monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.\n\nEventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.\n\nDown into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.\n\nOver the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!\n\nOver the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! \n\nOver the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!\n\nHe had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.\n\nSlowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. \n\nShock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!\n\n\"Do you want me to tell you what it was?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\n\nPs. Im so sorry"}, {"created": "2019-07-19", "score": "3", "title": "What comes after 69?", "body": "\"Nice.\""}, {"created": "2019-07-19", "score": "2", "title": "What do the KKK and Sketchers have in common?", "body": "Both make black people run faster."}, {"created": "2019-07-19", "score": "2", "title": "What is green and has wheels?", "body": "Grass.

Somehow, he got his old job back at the train. He drove for about 2 weeks, then he crashed again. He killed even more people. And again, he was sentenced the death penalty. This time, he asked for 2 bananas. He got electrocuted, there was a puff of smoke and a flash of light. He didn't die, again. He was let go again. He got his job back, despite crashing 2 trains. And he crashed again, this time being the only survivor. He was sentenced the death penalty again. This time he asked for 3 bananas. This time though, the executor said \"You know what? No. I've had it with these stupid bananas. I'm not giving you any.\" So even though it was against protocol, they put him into the chair with no last meal. This time, there was a puff of smoke, a flash of light, and still he wasn't dead. So he said \"Oh, it had nothing to do with bananas. I'm just a bad conductor.\""}, {"created": "2019-03-25", "score": "3", "title": "How many Russians does it take for Hillary Clinton to lose an election?", "body": "None"}, {"created": "2019-03-25", "score": "24", "title": "Did you hear about the drumset who is obsessed with puns?", "body": "His name is Badaum Tushh\n\n"}, {"created": "2019-03-25", "score": "9", "title": "What do you call my dad?", "body": "A run away."}, {"created": "2019-03-25", "score": "7", "title": "Did you hear about the antique stick of gum?", "body": "It was in mint condition"}, {"created": "2019-03-24", "score": "10", "title": "What can you get against somebody that keeps tripping over you?", "body": "a re-sprain-ing order."}, {"created": "2019-03-24", "score": "6", "title": "What did the smoker say when he wanted to quit?", "body": "Well, guess it's time to pack it in."}, {"created": "2019-03-24", "score": "43", "title": "What is Forrest Gump's email password?", "body": "1forrest1"}, {"created": "2019-03-23", "score": "2", "title": "I always end my sentences with period", "body": ""}, {"created": "2019-03-23", "score": "33", "title": "I have hands but I can\u2019t feel, I can tell the time but I can\u2019t speak, what am I?", "body": "A paralyzed man."}, {"created": "2019-03-22", "score": "6", "title": "What did the hamburgers name their daughter?", "body": "PATTY\n\n\nyeah i'll go "}, {"created": "2019-03-22", "score": "26", "title": "Why was the broom late for work?", "body": "He OVERSWEPT"}, {"created": "2019-03-22", "score": "5", "title": "Did you hear about the Italian chef who died?", "body": "He pasta-way."}, {"created": "2019-03-22", "score": "5", "title": "Permaban joke", "body": "So, ban a guy from a game.

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\""}, {"created": "2019-02-18", "score": "0", "title": "Chloe's pants are revealing her cameltoe.", "body": "Don't tell the Arabs!

The fish looks up, sees the fly and thinks \u201cif the fly dropped about three inches I could jump up and eat it\u201d\n\n\nNear the river is a hungry bear who has been looking at the fish. It sees the fish looking at the fly and thinks \u201cif that fly dropped 3 inches, the fish will jump up and catch it and I can run and eat the fish\u201d\n\n\nAbove them there\u2019s a cliff and on that cliff is a hunter with a rifle and a sandwich. Through his scope he sees the bear looking at the fish and the fish looking at the fly. He thinks \u201coh man, if that fly dropped 3 inches, the fish will jump up and catch it and the bear will run and eat the fish, then I can shoot it\u201d.\n\n\nNear that hunter is a tree and under the tree is a mouse who has been eyeing the hunters sandwich. It sees the hunter looking at the bear, the bear looking at the fish and the fish looking at the fly. It thinks \u201calright so if that fly drops 3 inches, the fish will jump up and catch it and the bear will run and eat the fish. Then the hunter will have to drop his sandwich to shoot the bear and I can run and grab the sandwich\u201d.\n\n\nThis would work well for the mouse if not for the fact that above him on one of the trees branches is the apex predator. A very quick and patient one eyed cat. The cat sees the mouse looking at the hunter. The hunter looking at the bear. The bear looking at the fish and the fish looking at the fly\n\nLike all the others the cat thinks \u201cif that fly drops 3 inches, the fish will jump up and catch it and the bear will run and eat the fish. Then the hunter will have to drop his sandwich to shoot the bear and the mouse will run and grab the sandwich. Then I can make my move, oh the joy of the hunt. Huzzah!\u201d\n\nSo, after a moment the fly starts dropping lower, the hunter drops his sandwich to ready himself. Suddenly, the fish jumps up and catches the fly, savouring the taste of his victory. Whilst that is happening the mouse runs to the sandwich and the cat pounces on the mouse. However as our cat has one eye depth perception wasn\u2019t his strong suit.\n\nInstead of landing on the mouse it lands claws first on the hunter, causing the hunter to fire a bullet that misses the bear and to stomp on his sandwich. The mouse is scared of the boot and runs off, the hunter knocks the cat off and sends it flying off the cliff. The bear got scared off by the bullet and ran and the cat landed in the river, while its thrashing around and getting wet the fish swam away.\n\nThere are a few morals to this story.\n1. Keep your eyes on the prize, but also on the dangers around it\n2. The best laid plans can be screwed up by other people out for themselves \n3. When the fly drops a few inches the pussy gets wet"}, {"created": "2018-03-19", "score": "7", "title": "What's a pirate's favourite canned meal?", "body": "Chef BoyARRRRRRdee"}, {"created": "2018-03-19", "score": "20", "title": "I was going to make a chemistry joke, but I figured Na...", "body": "It would just make everyone salty.

His name is Matt, and is a mob boss who is the head of the Goose Mafia. The Goose Mafia run amok through the streets of London, murdering the Chicken Advocates. The Chicken Advocates are a rival Mafia gang, who motorbike around the London Suburbs. Matt looks possibly threatening, with his black fedora and peat coat eclipsing his head and body. A long grey scarf wrapped around his neck like a boa constrictor. Matt, his fist clenching something in his pocket, walked up to the bar, a man with an ebony beard tending to a neighborhood-famous drunk. Matt walked up to the bartender, his mouth only being visible. \"One Duke Of Thames, sir,\" Matt bellowed deeply. The ebony-bearded man nodded, reaching for a glass that hung on a rack. \"So, you're a Gooseman?\" said the bartender, obviously trying to make small talk. \"No, I'm a Cluckganger myself.\" Matt lied. He then rubbed the Goose tattoo that was on his left arm. He fabricated that he was a Cluckganger, because Goosemen were discriminated in the section of neighborhoods the bar was located in. The bartender put the glass under a spigot. He filled it with a cocktail of liquor, beer, and a thick, green liquid. Matt himself didn't know what the thick mix was, but it was still his preferred drink. \"Two New Dollars.\" said the bartender. Matt dug into his pockets, and pulled out the two bills. Matt drank the alcoholic concoction, the liquid sliding down his throat like a stick of margarine. He moved his sleeve across his lips, clearing any extra residue of the Duke of Thames. \"D...delicious.\" Matt stammered. It tasted like dyed marshmallow fluff with a mix of alcohol, specifically beer. The bartender looked suspiciously at Matt. \"You're a Gooseman.\". Matt's eyes grew wide like tea saucers. \"Don't worry, I don't discriminate.\" the man said. \"Ermmm... how did you...\" Matt stammered. \"Don't act like I didn't see the tattoo.\" the man grinned. Matt's eyes darted from corner to corner of the room. Matt looked paralyzed. \"Oh, and by the way,\" said the man. Matt made a gesture to elaborate. \"it gets them every time.\" Matt reached into his coat pocket, and reached for his revolver. He pulled it out quickly, and the man pulled out a handgun from under the bar. Matt fired quickly, although it missed him. A bullet hit Matt's shoulder. Matt ran out the door, his sleeve lifting up. The goose tattoo was made visible to the whole bar. \"Ree!\" one of the normies in the bar shouted. People starting chasing him, all shouting \"ree!\" like a bunch of rare Pepes. As Matt ran down the icy street, the bar-goers yelped their comic frog war cries. Matt felt his strength deteriorating, his vision slowly fading.

Best bit was, it turned out my teacher was irish and grown up during the IRA troubles, and didn't like the fact that i was looking at what appeared to be assault rifles on the internet.\n\nNow i played it off and started acting cocky, saying that i didn't care how the teacher felt, and that he should respect everyone's hobbies and interests, even if their interests piss him off.\n\nNow this pissed off the manager of the college, and before i knew it, two police officers turned up and immediately started grilling me, saying i was breaking this law and i committed a \"promoting racial hatred\" offense. \n\nImmediately i knew the police were talking out their ass, and that technically freedom of speech was going to cover my stupidity... I weighed it all up and i put my chances at 50 / 50.\n\nI was escorted out the college by the police, and walked me back to my motorbike.\n\nAfter riding home, i went to my father and explained the situation, and me and him had a good laugh about it, and we both thought nothing more would come of this situation.\n\nWell a couple weeks pass, and i get a knock on my door, its the police officer who escorted me out of the college, she said that i was going to be interviewed under caution for the \"promoting racial hatred\" offense in a few days, and that i needed to attend the local police station.\n\nSo i did what most people did and i got a solicitor on the case, so i at least had my ass covered in that sense.\n\nA few days pass and i go to the police station for the interview and meet with my appointed solicitor.\n\nBefore the interview, me and my solicitor had a one on one chat in a closed office to discuss the so called \"case\" the police were building on me.\n\nNow what the lawyer said the moment he entered the office both made me feel ecstatic and pissed me off at the same time.\n\nThe lawyer walks in, sits down in front of me, pulls out some police statements, and basically says, \"what the hell are you doing here, you haven't committed any offenses at all. \n\nNow i'm sat there staring at the lawyer with my mouth open basically going \"what the fuck, i know i haven't broken the law, now why have the police got such a huge stick up their ass about it\"\n\nwell we went in for the interview, i answered their questions, and right at the end, my solicitor piped up and said to the officer, \"in my opinion, this guy hasn't broken any laws and i will discuss this in detail with you outside\"\n\nI leave the interview room and wait in the office for ten minutes, before my solicitor and the police officer turn up, the officer apologizes for wasting my time and that they will not take this issue any further.\n\nAfter leaving the station i went back home, and then a month later, i went to airsoft completely decked out in my SS uniform.\n\nNow to say i pissed people off was an understatement... several of the regular players were ex military, and one in particular worked as a royal guardsman for the queen... Me cracking shower and gas jokes during the day really didn't help either.\n\nI got a fuck ton of abuse, called a racist bastard and everything else you could think of.\n\nAbout half way though the day, the fucking airsoft site owner turns up, due to getting multiple complaints about my attire, so he walks up to me, and basically tells me to fuck off and not return.\n\nAs i'm leaving the site, i decided to give them one last joke, and i immediately swung round, stuck my arm in the air and yelled sieg heil at the top of my lungs. \n\nIn my opinion, best \u00a3400 i ever spent."}, {"created": "2017-10-24", "score": "6", "title": "Which is the medicine that you can't trust?", "body": "Benedryl Arnold"}, {"created": "2017-10-23", "score": "2", "title": "Movember's coming up, terrible moustaches for charity.", "body": "They should just call it November, amirite??"}, {"created": "2017-10-23", "score": "19", "title": "\"Take on me\" is stuck in my head", "body": "But it'll be gone in a day or two."}, {"created": "2017-10-21", "score": "16", "title": "Who's the fastest cow in the world?", "body": "MOOOOsain Bolt "}, {"created": "2017-10-20", "score": "22", "title": "Worst joke of all time", "body": "\n\nSo there was once a man who had always wanted to be a train conductor all of his life.

Save me and I will buy you dinner wherever you like!\"\n\nSeconds later, two muscular swedish arms reached from a nearby window and pulled him to safety, Benny had saved the day once again and that night as promised, the man took him to eat at pizza express.\n\nHearing of these wonderful feats of heroism, the BBC hurriedly booked an interview with Benny to ask him all about his newfound fame, Michael Parkinson took the helm and began the Interview.\n\"Well, Benny, We've known each other a long time, are you planning to perform heroics like these regularly?\"\n\nThe Heroic musician adjusted his chair, leaned forward and whispered\n\n\"If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, for Nando's\""}, {"created": "2017-10-11", "score": "7", "title": "A professor tells a student to count to 10", "body": "The student says 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

The shift foreman told us to simply assemble the thing outside but that was impossible because there wasn't a doorframe above 8'. So we went to the stage crew foreman since the stage itself didn't look like there was much work done right now and he told us that yes, we could put it on stage but we had to make it quick.

Candidates had been eliminated to the point where the only two left were Singapore and Nevers, France. The French venue had an obvious advantage for the games, but the Singaporeans were eager to host the games in their country, so they developed a snow-making machine. Because of technical glitches, the machine produced snow only part of the time. The rest of the time it produced steam, and you can't ski on steam. So they made a last-ditch effort to perfect the machine, knowing that the deadline for a decision from the committee was nigh. To bring moral support and entertainment to the workers, they brought in Elvis Presley, who mounted the stage and said, \"Well, today's the day your machine must produce snow. If it belches out steam, the games will go to France. So this is it.

To start off, they don't have a roof to live under, if you don't count the tattered blue tarp that has become synonymous with homelessness, and a universal symbol of despair. It really is a pitiable situation when homeless families keep increasing in size, because the parents lack knowledge of contraception and even if they did, wouldn't be able to afford it without skipping a meal (America, the land of costly healthcare and INR 311.85 condoms), and even if they wanted to, termination of pregnancy was not affordable for them, something eugenics components have been using as an argument in favor of forced sterilization for decades.\n\nThe problems multiply when alcohol and mental instability is introduced to the situation. For instance, an Indo-Hispanic named Rahul Gutierrez moved to America after being fired by Maersk India (a logistics company), for revealing the existence of a confidential blacklist to a blacklisted applicant. Rahul couldn't find a better job in the United States, and soon was evicted by his impatient landlady for not paying his rent for three months in a row. He had three children, Riu, Ree, and Red, all of whom he had named when he was drunk. He blamed Red for his being evicted, as it was Red's birth that made his wife leave him and fall off the grid.\n\nAs such, he treated Red like she wasn't his daughter. Riu and Ree, however, were kindhearted to Red and, considering that they were twins and the family was poor, always got a mutual present for their birthday that they would have to share (and that Red would have to avoid touching at all costs, a rule laid down by their father out of resentment). Before he was evicted, he used the last of his money to buy a small cycle for the twins. However, a month after being evicted, he realized that to ensure survival for the next month, he would have to sell it. \n\nThe twins, being the understanding angels that he had raised them (and only them) to be, they understood, and made no protest. However, they had a request to make. They wanted a last day with the cycle before he could take it to the store. He had enough change to last a day, and let them have their last few hours with it. However, they did not use it. Red was in for a surprise, as the twins took her to the local park and told her to go nuts with it. And for the first time since moving to America, she smiled. She gave a tight hug to her sisters, who were grinning ear to ear the whole time. And for the first and the last time ever, Red used Riu's and Ree's cycle."}, {"created": "2014-02-02", "score": "17", "title": "Bad Joke of the Day: February 2, 2014", "body": "*Knock, knock.*\n\nWho's there?\n\n*To.*\n\nTo who?\n\n*To whom.*"}, {"created": "2014-02-01", "score": "23", "title": "What do you call a fish with no eye?", "body": "Fsh."}, {"created": "2014-02-01", "score": "9", "title": "Bad Joke of the Day: February 1, 2014", "body": "**Pam:** Coach, can you teach me how to do the splits?\n\n**Gymnastics Coach:** How flexible are you?\n\n**Pam:** I can't do Tuesdays.

For that occasion the priest has prepared a fiery sermon. When finally the midwife brings the child it turns out to be white. Obviously the priest is rather embarrassed but the tribe and the chief in particular will not let this one slip without an explanation.

The owner of the bell tower held auditions to find someone new to ring the bells every day.  Many applied, but alas, none could make the bells ring as beautiful as Quasimoto could. So the owner eventually gave up his search and began boarding up the bell tower, leaving the bells to fall silent upon the city of Paris. Just then, a very short, peculiar man with no arms came up to him and said \"Is it too late to audition to be the bell ringer?\"   The owner said \"Well sure you could try out I guess, but how are you going to ring the bells with no arms?\" and the man just gave him a wink and said \"You'll see.\"  So they marched up the 50 flights of stairs to the top of the bell tower. Once at the top the owner said \"Okay, here we are. Lets see what you've got.\"   The man took a few steps back, then broke out into a full sprint at one of the bells. He leapt into the air at one of the bells, hitting it with his face! It made the most beautiful sound the owner had ever heard. EVEN more beautiful than Quasimoto could ever make them sound. So he told the man \"You're hired! You start at dawn tomorrow!\"   \nSo dawn tomorrow comes around. The man climbs up the 50 flights of stairs to the top of the bell tower, takes a few steps back, leaps into the air, and MISSES THE BELL!!  He flies out the window, falling to his death.  After a few moments, a crowd begins to gather around his body in the streets of paris below. There are murmurs of confusion going about the crowd. Nobody knows what just happened. The sherif then arrives and asks \"Does anyone know who this man is?\"   From the back of the crowd a voice shouts out \"I don't know, BUT HIS FACE RINGS A BELL!!!\""}, {"created": "2012-09-16", "score": "0", "title": "Why does the word \"hiding\" starts with \"hi\"?
