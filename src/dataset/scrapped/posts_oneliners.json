We are glad we were able to help and reach this achievement, but we will of course be striving to broaden this community and hopefully we will be able to hit 15k next. \n\nAnyway, here\u2019s what we will be doing in celebration of 13k:\n\n\n* We will be implementing new CSS which /u/KudosInc has created.\n\n\n\n* We are introducing a new moderator, /u/meatgmaildotcom.\n\n* We are updating the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneliners/wiki/index).\n\n* We will be attempting to post more games such as the previous contests which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneliners/comments/66twzy/roneliners_biweekly_tournament_1_may_2017/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneliners/comments/68fcwp/roneliners_biweekly_contest_2_may_2017/). \n\n\n* We will be adding a Oneliner\u2122 of the month in the sidebar; the user who posted the oneliner will receive a special flair.\n\n\n\n-----\n\nI\u2019d also like to use this occasion to reintroduce to everyone what /r/oneliners is about:\n\nr/oneliners hosts a variety of funny, one line jokes in a well-moderated, friendly community.
